# ML-Customer-Churn-Analysis-in-Banking


Overview

The ML-Driven Churn Analysis project is a data-centric initiative aimed at leveraging machine learning techniques to optimize customer retention strategies within the banking industry. Churn, the phenomenon where customers leave a service or product, can significantly impact a bank's profitability and customer satisfaction. By developing predictive models and analyzing churn patterns, this project seeks to empower banks to proactively address customer attrition, thereby enhancing their bottom line and customer relationships.

Motivation

The driving force behind this research is the imperative need to tackle customer churn in the highly competitive banking sector. Banks continuously strive to retain their existing customers as it is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. Predicting and preventing churn through data-driven insights can lead to improved customer satisfaction, increased revenue, and sustainable growth in a dynamic market.

Project Targets

Develop ML-Powered Churn Prediction Models: Create a robust machine learning algorithms capable of accurately predicting customer churn within the banking industry. These model leverages historical customer data, transactional information, and demographic factors to identify potential churners.

Optimize Retention Strategies: Determine effective strategies for retaining at-risk customers. Analyze the identified churn factors and recommend personalized retention actions, such as Enhanced Customer Engagement, Credit Card Services Improvement, or customer support initiatives.

Real-time Monitoring: Implement a real-time monitoring system to identify early warning signs of churn. This enables banks to take immediate actions to prevent customer attrition.

Evaluate Model Fairness: Address any bias or imbalance in the data to ensure that the churn prediction models are fair and do not discriminate against any particular group of customers.

Data and Methodology

The project relies on a comprehensive dataset comprising historical customer interactions, transactional data, demographic information, and market trends. Data preprocessing techniques, including feature engineering and cleansing, are applied to enhance data quality. Etreme Gradient Boosting algorithm, is employed to build accurate churn prediction models. Model performance is rigorously assessed using industry-standard metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. To assess the model's generalization performance, cross-validation was done. Interpretability tools are utilized to provide actionable insights into the factors driving churn, enabling banks to make data-informed decisions.
